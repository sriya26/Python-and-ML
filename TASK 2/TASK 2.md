# **Task-2**

---
## 1) _Numpy Library_
Referred to the video Python NumPy Tutorial for Beginners which was about various basics of numpy arrays:
>- The basic coperations, including getting the shape of the array,datatype, size of itemand number of elements.

>- Accessing andediting elements,rows and columns.

>- Initialising arrays, includings array of 0's and identity matrix and copying arrays.

>- Basic matrix maths like addition and subtraction , linear algebra that included matrix multiplication and determinant and array statistics.

>- Reorganising arrays,loading data from a file and concepts like Boolean Masking and Advanced Indexing.

## 2) _Pandas_
Referred to the video tutorial Python Pandas Data Science Tutorial which was about the basics of pandas library:
>- Loading data into pandas, reading csv and excel files.

>- Reading data in pandas i.e reading columns,rows and specific locations.

>- Describing data(finding out mean,std etc) sorting data by particular column in either ascending/descending order.

>- Making changes to the data, like dropping , creating or rearranging columns.

>- aving data and exporting it as csv/excel files.

>- Conditional changes , grouping values and counting occurence of elements in a column.

## 3) _Matplotlib_
Referred to Matplotlib tutorials playlist comprising of 10 videos about the matplotlib library to implement various kinds of plots to analyse data:
>- Creating a simple plot

>- Creating Bar chartsand getting data from csv files

>- Creating Pie charts, Stack plots, Histograms and Scatter plots

>- Plotting time series data and live data in real time

>- Creating subplots

## 4) _Scikit-Learn_
Referred to Scikit-Learn Course - Machine Learning in Python Tutorial which dealt with the different features of Scikit-learn machine learning library in python:
>- Introduction to features and labels of a dataset, classification and train test split.

>- Usage of KNN to classify car data, SVM to classify iris dataset, Linear Regression to classify boston housing dataset and K Means Clustering for breast cancer dataset.

>- Introduction to neural networks, overfitting and underfitting, backpropagation, cost function , gradient descent and Convolutional neural network (CNN)

>- Applying the above mentioned deep learning concepts to create a handwriting classifier for mnist dataset in order to recognise numbers using ReLU Activation function and ADAM Optimiser.
## 5) _Open CV_
Referred to python Open CV playlist to get familiarised with the Open CV library in python's operations and features along with introduction to Haar Cascade for object detection:

>- Method to load images and video (either dowloaded videos or through webcam)

>- Image operations and manipulations:
>>- Drawing and writing on images
>>- Combining two or more images 
>>- Thresholding i.e, simplifying visual data for analysis
>>- Morphological Transformations like erosion to eliminate white noise, dilation which is the opposite of erosion,openingto remove "false positives" and "closing" is to remove false negatives.
>>-Canny Edge Detection and Gradients i.e gradients used to measure directional intensity, and edge detection to find edges.
>>- Template matching, foregroud extraction and background removal, corner detection to track things like motion, do 3D modeling, and recognize objects, shapes, and characters.
>>- Homography or feature matching to search for image within anotehr image.
>- MOG Background Reduction to reduce the background of images, by detecting motion.
>- Object detection with Haar Cascade to detect face and eyes and futher tying out with other objects.
