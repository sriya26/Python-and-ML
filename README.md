# Python-and-ML
## Task-1
1) Completed Crash Course on Python by Google on Coursera. Learnt basics of python including datatypes,data structures like strings, dictionaries,lists etc. and Object Oriented Programming.
2) Implemented the Word Cloud project as a part of the course. Used the concept of dictionaries to track occurence of different words in a textfile and used wordcloud and matplotlib to create a Word Cloud.
3) Created two games i.e, Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect Four using Python. Used functions and data structures and also used numpy in Connect Four to create a matrix.

## Task-2
1) Referred to videos on Numpy and Pandas to get familiar with the usage of these python libraries.
2) Completed Matplotlib library playlist which dealt with methods of various type of plots and graphs.
3) Scikit-Learn library in python for machine learning and implemented KNN, K Means clustering, SVM, Linear Regression and basic neural networks to classify and predict values for datasets.
4) Completed Open CV playlist and implemented various image and video methods along with getting familiar with Haar Cascade for object detection.

## Task-3
1) Did the Deep Learning Specialisation on Coursera which dealt with the basics of neural networks,architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTMs, Transformers, and learn how to make them better with strategies such as Dropout, BatchNorm andXavier/He initialization.
2) Optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, ML Strategies, learning to tackle real-world cases such as speech recognition, music synthesis, chatbots, machine translation, natural language processing, and more.
3) Using Python, TensorFlow and Keras to implement ML tasks
