# **Task-3**

---

This task was all about completing the Deep Learning Specialisation on Coursera.
## 1) Neural Networks and Deep Learning__
First course of the Deep Learning Specialization,all about the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. 
>-Introduction to Neural Networks,Vectorisation, Forward and Back Propagation,Shallow and Deep Neural Networks.

>-Logistic Regression, Classification and Deep Neural Network models for CV. 

## 2) _Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization_
Second course of the Deep Learning Specialization:
>-Best practices to train and develop test sets and analyze bias/variance for building deep learning applications

>-Standard neural network techniques such as initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, hyperparameter tuning, batch normalization, and gradient checking

>-Optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence

>-Implement a neural network in TensorFlow.


## 3) _Structuring Machine Learning Projects_
Third course of the Deep Learning Specialization,all about how to build a successful machine learning project.

>-Diagnosing errors in a machine learning system

>-Strategies for reducing errors

>-ML settings, such as mismatched training/test sets, and comparing to and/or surpassing human-level performance

>-End-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning.
